## üêç Welcome to Coral OS!

[üáßüá∑ PT-BR version: [pt-br.md](https://github.com/Coral-OS/README/blob/main/pt-br.md) ]

**Coral OS** is a distribution based on Arch Linux, inspired by the beauty and unique patterns of the Brazilian coral snake. Born from a passion for embedded systems, digital privacy, and functional minimalism, this distro aims to balance **freedom, lightness, and ease of use** ‚Äî even for those just starting out in the Linux world.

The project began as part of a personal portfolio, but it's being developed with care and attention to detail, serving as a solid foundation for learning, daily use, and experimentation.

## Philosophy of Coral OS

Coral OS follows a few core principles:

‚Ü≥ **Minimalism with purpose**  
Less is more. The goal is not to deliver a barebones system, but rather a lightweight and functional base with essential packages that help new users get started ‚Äî without sacrificing simplicity or freedom of choice.

‚Ü≥ **Privacy and transparency**  
All default programs are selected based on two criteria: **respect for user privacy** and **open source**. Browsers, utilities, and tools are carefully chosen ‚Äî like Brave, which offers stability, performance, and a strong focus on privacy.
